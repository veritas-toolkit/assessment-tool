<#-- F3.1 After a consistent and reasonable identification process, what are the fairness objectives that fit the commercial objectives and decision outcomes of the system? -->

<div>
The fairness objectives of the marketing system are:
<ul>
<li>not increase disparate harms to different groups;</li>
<li>the benefit to the customer in receiving a loan they would not otherwise have acquired is exactly proportional to the profit uplift of the system;</li>
<li>the profits of the system need to be viewed in light of, and traded off against, the harms from the application process and from outcomes of the loans;</li>
<li>monitor equality in the benefit from receiving the intervention.</li>
</ul>
</div>
