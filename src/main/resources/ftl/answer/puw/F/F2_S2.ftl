<#--F2.2 What are the most important harms and benefits to consider for the groups as at risk of disadvantages in F1? -->
<div>

Another harm identified was of a surcharge on all insured to cover the cost of those that were incorrectly assessed as eligible by the system.
<br>The potential benefits that are particularly relevant to groups identified in F1 are cheaper insurance and the convenience of simplified underwriting to reduce mortality protection gap.
